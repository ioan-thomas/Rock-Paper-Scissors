# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A rock paper scissors game 

This game was made while following the online curriculum The Odin Project. 

I had previously created the game logic from another Odin Project lesson but it only worked in the console log.

In this new iteration I will be manipulating the DOM to create an interactive game.

I will be adding a pop up screen soon, as well as some refinment to the code and overall look of the project.
